      <h1>History</h1>
      <h2>Before the Saadians</h2>
      <p>The early history of the necropolis is not well known. The necropolis is located right behind 
        the qibla wall (in this case the southeastern wall) of the Kasbah Mosque which was built, along 
        with the surrounding royal kasbah (citadel), by the Almohad caliph Abu Yusuf Ya'qub (al-Mansur)
         in the late 12th century (1185-1190). Accordingly, it is believed that this was the site of a 
         necropolis even in Almohad times, though there's no evidence of any significant figures being 
         buried here at that time (the Almohad rulers were buried at Tinmal instead).[3][4][2]: 393  
         It is known, however, that in the 14th century, during the Marinid dynasty period, Sultan Abu 
         al-Hasan was buried here temporarily in 1351. He died while in exile in the High Atlas mountains
          and Marrakesh was thus the closest city for burial (which, under Islamic tradition, must be 
          carried out quickly). A few months later his body was then moved and reburied in the Marinid 
          royal necropolis at Chellah (near Rabat).[4] A marble tombstone with a long inscription attests
           to his first burial in the Marrakesh kasbah necropolis, and this tombstone is still found in 
           the Chamber of the Three Niches in the Saadian tombs today (presumably moved there during or 
           after Saadian construction).[4]: 184  The Marinid sultan's burial here suggests that it must 
           have already been a cemetery at the time.[4] Afterwards, the necropolis also became the burial 
           site of the Hintati emirs who controlled the region of Marrakesh from the mid-15th century until
            the 1520s. Some of their epitaphs are still visible today.</p>
            <h2>The Saadian necropolis</h2>
            <p>The present necropolis dates generally from the Saadian period but there are still 
              some questions about the chronology and attribution of the various constructions which 
              have not been resolved beyond doubt.[4] The most generally cited timeline and the most 
              complete analysis was laid out by Deverdun in 1959, based on a number of arguments and 
              lines of evidence.</p>
              <h2>Beginnings under Abdallah al-Ghalib</h2>
              <p>The necropolis has two major structures: one to the east, surrounded by gardens on either side, and one to the west, next to the visitor entrance today. The eastern mausoleum started out first as a simple square mausoleum chamber adjoining the southern wall of the Kasbah Mosque. It is believed that this first mausoleum was built by the second Saadian sultan of Marrakesh, Moulay Abdallah al-Ghalib, between 1557 and 1574.[7] Abdallah was already a prolific builder throughout his reign and it seems he wished to erect a mausoleum to honor his father Muhammad al-Sheikh, the founder of the dynasty, who was killed in 1557 and buried here in what was probably a simple grave.[7][4] Before Muhammad al-Shaykh some Saadians – most notably al-Qai'm, the dynasty's founder, and Ahmad al-Araj and his sons – had been buried in the Zawiya of al-Jazuli and its adjoining cemetery in the city.[4]: 170–173 

Abdallah al-Ghalib himself was eventually buried next to his father in 1574, in the new mausoleum he had built. A dedicatory marble inscription panel was placed on the wall at the head of his tomb, but this panel was later moved (at an unknown date and for unknown reasons) to the Chamber of the Three Niches in the later western building.[7] It is probable (but unconfirmed) that the fourth Saadian sultan, Abd al-Malik, was also buried next to Muhammad al-Sheikh (also his father), on the south side of the latter's tomb, in 1578 or after</p>
